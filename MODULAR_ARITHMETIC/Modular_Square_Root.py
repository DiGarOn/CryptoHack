# In Legendre Symbol we introduced a fast way to determine whether a number is a square root modulo a prime. We can go further: there are algorithms for efficiently calculating such roots. The best one in practice is called Tonelli-Shanks, which gets its funny name from the fact that it was first described by an Italian in the 19th century and rediscovered independently by Daniel Shanks in the 1970s.
#
# All primes that aren't 2 are of the form p ≡ 1 mod 4 or p ≡ 3 mod 4, since all odd numbers obey these congruences. As the previous challenge hinted, in the p ≡ 3 mod 4 case, a really simple formula for computing square roots can be derived directly from Fermat's little theorem. That leaves us still with the p ≡ 1 mod 4 case, so a more general algorithm is required.
#
# In a congruence of the form r2 ≡ a mod p, Tonelli-Shanks calculates r.
#
# Tonelli-Shanks doesn't work for composite (non-prime) moduli. Finding square roots modulo composites is computationally equivalent to integer factorization - that is, it's a hard problem.
#
#
# The main use-case for this algorithm is finding elliptic curve co-ordinates. Its operation is somewhat complex so we're not going to discuss the details, however, implementations are easy to find and Sage has one built-in.
#
# Find the square root of a modulo the 2048-bit prime p. Give the smaller of the two roots as your answer.
